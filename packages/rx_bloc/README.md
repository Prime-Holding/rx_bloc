# What is rx_bloc ?
![Slogan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Prime-Holding/rx_bloc/develop/packages/rx_bloc/doc/asset/slogan.png)

Along with the [rx_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/rx_bloc) the following set of packages will help you during the product development.
1. [flutter_rx_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_rx_bloc) that exposes your reactive BloCs to the UI Layer.
2. [rx_bloc_test](https://pub.dev/packages/rx_bloc_test) that facilitates implementing the unit tests for your BloCs
3. [rx_bloc_generator](https://pub.dev/packages/rx_bloc_generator) that boosts development efficiency by making your BloCs zero-boilerplate.

# Why rx_bloc ?
If you are working on a complex project you might be challenged to build a highly interactive UI or a heavy business logic in a combination with the consumption of various data sources such as REST APIs, Web Socket, Secured Storage, Shared Preferences, etc. To achieve this, you might need a sophisticated architecture that facilitates your work during product development.

# Usage
By definition, the BloC layer should contain only the business logic of your app. This means that it should be fully decoupled from the UI layer and should be loosely coupled with the data layer through Dependency Injection. The **UI** layer can send **events** to the BloC layer and can listen for **state** changes.

## Events
As you can see below, all events are just pure methods declared in one abstract class (CounterBlocEvents).
```dart
/// A contract, containing all Counter BloC events
abstract class CounterBlocEvents {
  /// Increment the count
  void increment();

  /// Decrement the count
  void decrement();
}
```
This way, we can push events to the BloC by simply invoking those methods from the UI layer as follows:
```dart
RaisedButton(
    onPressed: () => bloc.events.increment(),
    ...
) 
```

## States
The same way as with the events, now you can see that we have declarations for multiple states grouped in one abstract class (CounterBlocStates). Depending on your goals, you can either have just one stream with all needed data or you can split it into individual streams. In the latter case, you can apply the [Single-responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) or any performance optimizations.

```dart
/// A contract, containing all Counter BloC states
abstract class CounterBlocStates {
  /// The count of the Counter
  ///
  /// It can be controlled by executing
  /// [CounterBlocEvents.increment] and
  /// [CounterBlocEvents.decrement]
  ///
  Stream<int> get count;

  /// Loading state
  Stream<bool> get isLoading;

  /// User friendly error messages
  Stream<String> get errors;
}
```

## Zero-boilerplate BloC

Once we have defined the states and events contracts, it’s time to implement the actual Counter BloC. As mentioned previously, we are armed with [rx_bloc_generator](https://pub.dev/packages/rx_bloc_generator), which should be added to your pubspec.yaml file as follows:

```dart
dev_dependencies:
  build_runner:
  rx_bloc_generator:^1.0.1
```

Then we need to create an empty CounterBloc class in **counter_bloc.dart** (below the contracts) and just execute `flutter packages pub run build_runner build` from the root of your project.

[counter_bloc.dart](https://github.com/Prime-Holding/rx_bloc/blob/a1854040f1d693af5304bce7a5c2fa68c5809ecf/examples/counter/lib/bloc/counter_bloc.dart#L33)
```dart
...
@RxBloc()
class CounterBloc {}
```

After the generator completes the execution, make sure your IDE is in sync with the local files and you should see that a new file (**counter_bloc.rxb.g.dart**) has been created, which contains the parent class of our CounterBloc. In short, the [rx_bloc_generator](https://pub.dev/packages/rx_bloc_generator) package makes your BloC zero-boilerplate, as the generator automatically writes all the boring boilerplate code so you can focus on your business logic instead.

[counter_bloc.dart](https://github.com/Prime-Holding/rx_bloc/blob/a1854040f1d693af5304bce7a5c2fa68c5809ecf/examples/counter/lib/bloc/counter_bloc.dart#L33)
```dart
...
/// A BloC responsible for count calculations
@RxBloc()
class CounterBloc extends $CounterBloc {
  /// The default constructor injecting a repository through DI
  CounterBloc(this._repository);
  
  /// The repository used for data source communication
  final CounterRepository _repository;

  /// Map increment and decrement events to the `count` state
  @override
  Stream<int> _mapToCountState() => Rx.merge<Result<int>>([
            // On increment
            _$incrementEvent.flatMap((_) =>
                _repository.increment().asResultStream()),
            // On decrement
            _$decrementEvent.flatMap((_) => 
                _repository.decrement().asResultStream()),
        ])
        // This automatically handles the error and loading state.
        .setResultStateHandler(this)
        // Provide "success" response only.
        .whereSuccess()
        //emit 0 as an initial value
        .startWith(0);
    
  @override
  Stream<String> _mapToErrorsState() =>
      errorState.map((Exception error) => error.toString());

  @override
  Stream<bool> _mapToIsLoadingState() => loadingState;
}
```
As you can see, by extending [$CounterBloc](https://github.com/Prime-Holding/rx_bloc/blob/a1854040f1d693af5304bce7a5c2fa68c5809ecf/examples/counter/lib/bloc/counter_bloc.rxb.g.dart#L20), we must implement `Stream<int>` `_mapToCountState()` , which is the method responsible for the events-to-state business logic. Furthermore, we have [_$incrementEvent](https://github.com/Prime-Holding/rx_bloc/blob/a1854040f1d693af5304bce7a5c2fa68c5809ecf/examples/counter/lib/bloc/counter_bloc.dart#L44) and [_$decrementEvent](https://github.com/Prime-Holding/rx_bloc/blob/a1854040f1d693af5304bce7a5c2fa68c5809ecf/examples/counter/lib/bloc/counter_bloc.dart#L47), which are the [subjects](https://pub.dev/documentation/rxdart/latest/rx_subjects/rx_subjects-library.html) where the events will flow when [increment()](https://github.com/Prime-Holding/rx_bloc/blob/a1854040f1d693af5304bce7a5c2fa68c5809ecf/examples/counter/lib/bloc/counter_bloc.dart#L10) and [decrement()](https://github.com/Prime-Holding/rx_bloc/blob/a1854040f1d693af5304bce7a5c2fa68c5809ecf/examples/counter/lib/bloc/counter_bloc.dart#L13) methods are invoked from the UI Layer.
In the code above we declare that as soon as the user taps on the increment or decrement button, an API call will be executed. Since both _$incrementEvent and _$decrementEvent are grouped in one stream by the merge operator, the result of their API calls allows us to register our BloC as a state handler. For more information what is State Handler and how it works, look at [this article](https://medium.com/prime-holding-jsc/introducing-rx-bloc-part-2-faf956f2bd99#c627). We then extract only the “success” result and finally put an initial value of 0.

## Accessing the BloC from the widget treee

[RxBlocProvider](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_rx_bloc/latest/flutter_rx_bloc/RxBlocProvider-class.html) is a Flutter widget that provides a BloC to its children via RxBlocProvider.of<T>(context). It is used as a dependency injection (DI) widget so that a single instance of a BloC can be provided to multiple widgets within a subtree.
  
```dart
MaterialApp(
    ...
    home: RxBlocProvider<CounterBlocType>(
        create: (context) => CounterBloc(CounterRepository()),
        child: const HomePage(),
    ),
);
```
[RxBlocBuilder](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_rx_bloc/latest/flutter_rx_bloc/RxBlocBuilder-class.html) is a Flutter widget that requires a RxBloc, a builder, and a state function. RxBlocBuilder handles building the widget in response to new states. RxBlocBuilder is very similar to StreamBuilder but has a more simple API to reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed.
```dart
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) =>
    Scaffold(
      ...
      RxBlocBuilder<CounterBlocType, int>(
        state: (bloc) => bloc.states.count,
        builder: (context, snapshot, bloc) => 
          snapshot.hasData ? 
            Text(snapshot.data.toString()): 
            Container()
  )
}
```

## rx_bloc_list

The *[rx_bloc_list](https://pub.dev/packages/rx_bloc_list)* package facilitates implementing `infinity scroll` and `pull-to-refresh` features with minimal setup. This package is meant to be used along with *[RxBloc ecosystem](https://medium.com/prime-holding-jsc/introducing-rx-bloc-ecosystem-part-1-3cc5f4fff14e)*.

### Usage

Before using the actual package add it to the `pubspec.yaml` dependencies:
```yaml
dependencies:
  rx_bloc_list: any
```
Also be sure to import the package:
```dart
import 'package:rx_bloc_list/rx_bloc_list.dart';
```
Now you can include the ***RxPaginatedBuilder*** in your project like this:


```dart
class PaginatedListPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Scaffold(
        body: SafeArea(
          child: RxPaginatedBuilder<UserBlocType, User>.withRefreshIndicator(
            state: (bloc) => bloc.states.paginatedList,
            onBottomScrolled: (bloc) => bloc.events.loadPage(),
            onRefresh: (bloc) async {
              bloc.events.loadPage(reset: true);
              return bloc.states.refreshDone;
            },
            buildSuccess: (context, list, bloc) => ListView.builder(
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final user = list.getItem(index);

                if (user == null) {
                  return const YourProgressIndicator();
                }

                return YourListTile(user: user);
              },
              itemCount: list.itemCount,
            ),
            buildLoading: (context, list, bloc) =>
                const YourProgressIndicator(),
            buildError: (context, list, bloc) =>
                YourErrorWidget(error: list.error!),
          ),
        ),
      );
}
```

### Setup

In order to make use of the RxPaginatedBuilder, you first need to specify the following required parameters:
- `state` is the state of the BLoC that will be listened for changes. The state is a `Stream<PaginatedList<T>>` where T is the type of the data that is being paginated.
- `buildSuccess` is a callback which is invoked when the list is not empty or when the next page is being loaded.
- `buildError` is a callback which is invoked when the `state` is of type `Result.error`
- `buildLoading` is a callback which is invoked only on the initial loading.
- `onBottomScrolled` is a callback that is executed once the end of the list is reached. This can be, for instance, used for fetching the next page of data.

<div id="additional-params" />

### Additional parameters

*RxPaginatedBuilder* also comes with additional optional parameters that can be adjusted to your needs.

The `wrapperBuilder` method is a builder method with the intention of creating a wrapper widget around the child widget built using the `buildSuccess`, `buildError` and `buildLoading` methods. The wrapperBuilder method gives you access to the `BuildContext`, `BLoC` containing the state that is listened and the `Widget` that is build with the `builders` method. This method can be used for adding additional functionality or help in cases when the built child widget is needed beforehand.

You can manage the execution of the `onBottomScrolled` parameter by enabling or disabling it via the `enableOnBottomScrolledCallback`.

Additionally, you can define the minimum scroll threshold which will execute the `onBottomScrolled` callback by changing the value of `scrollThreshold`. The default value of the scroll threshold is 100 pixels.

The RxPaginatedBuilder also provides the ability to react to scrolling via the `onScrolled` callback, with a parameter telling whether the user is or has stopped scrolling.

There may be cases where you have a reference to the BLoC that is used by the RxPaginatedBuilder. By specifying the `bloc` parameter you remove the need to perform a lookup for that BLoC in the widget tree, improving the performance by a small bit.

<div id="withRefreshIndicator" />

### RxPaginatedBuilder.withRefreshIndicator

Sometimes, you may want to have a working pagination and pull-to-refresh without spending too much time on it. Using the *RxPaginatedBuilder.withRefreshIndicator* gives you access to a [Refresh Indicator](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/RefreshIndicator-class.html "Refresh Indicator") straight out of the box.

Along with the required parameters of the default implementation, *RxPaginatedBuilder.withRefreshIndicator* gets rid of the `wrapperBuilder` but introduces a new required parameter `onRefresh`. The `onRefresh` callback is triggered once a pull-to-refresh has been performed. The callback, containing the BLoC as a parameter, should return a future, which once complete will make the refresh indicator disappear.

<div id="withLatestFromIdentifiableList" />

### withLatestFromIdentifiableList()

If you want to keep the list of items inside your bloc up to date based on a stream of updated items, you can use the *withLatestFromIdentifiableList()* extension method. It merges, removes or ignores the value of the stream from the latest `list` value. The result, based on the `operationCallback`, will be emitted as a new value([ManagedList](https://github.com/Prime-Holding/rx_bloc/blob/develop/packages/rx_bloc_list/lib/src/models/managed_list.dart)). With the help of the CoordinatorBloc our two features can communicate with each other and have different or the same elements from the same list collection. In the bellow example, for every operation we have, a state in the `CoordinatorBloc` is updated and an `operationCallback` is executed.

```dart
states.onReminderCreated.whereSuccess()
    .withLatestFromIdentifiableList(
      reminderList,
      operationCallback: (ReminderModel createdModel, List<ReminderModel> list) async {
        if (list.isNotEmpty) {
          final lastElementDueDate = list.last.dueDate;
          if (lastElementDueDate.compareTo(createdModel.dueDate) > 0) {
            return ManageOperation.merge;
          }
        }
        return ManageOperation.ignore;
      },
    )
    .bind(reminderList)
```

The method [withLatestFromIdentifiableList()](https://github.com/Prime-Holding/rx_bloc/blob/develop/packages/rx_bloc_list/lib/src/extensions/identifiable_extensions.dart) accepts two parameters. The `list` parameter should be of type `Stream<List<E>>`, where `E extends Identifiable`. The model implementing [Identifiable](https://github.com/Prime-Holding/rx_bloc/blob/develop/packages/rx_bloc_list/lib/src/models/identifiable.dart), should provide implementation for the *bool isEqualToIdentifiable(Identifiable other)* method, so that the identifiable extension method knows how to distinguish between the models in the list.
The `operationCallback` parameter should be a function, which receives as first parameter the `Identifiable` model and as second the `list`. The returned value from the function is a [ManageOperation](https://github.com/Prime-Holding/rx_bloc/blob/develop/packages/rx_bloc_list/lib/src/models/managed_list.dart).

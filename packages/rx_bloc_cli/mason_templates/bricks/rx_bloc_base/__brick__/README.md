## Getting started

Before you start working on your app, make sure you familiarize yourself with the structure of the generated project and the essentials that are included with it.

*Note:* The app contains features that request data from API endpoints hosted on a local server. For the app to function properly, make sure the local server is up and running. For more info, check out the [server topic](#server).

## Architecture

For in-depth review of the following architecture watch [this][architecture_overview] presentation.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Prime-Holding/rx_bloc/develop/packages/rx_bloc_cli/mason_templates/bricks/rx_bloc_base/__brick__/docs/app_architecture.png" alt="Rx Bloc Architecture"></img>

## Routing

The routing throughout the app is handled by [GoRouter][gorouter_lnk].


You can use the [IntelliJ RxBloC Plugin][intellij_plugin], which automatically does all steps instead of you, or to manualy add your route to the `lib/lib_router/routes/routes.dart`. Once the route is added one of the following shell scripts `bin/build_runner_build.sh`(or `bin/build_runner_watch.sh`) needs to be executed.


The navigation is handled by the business layer `lib/lib_router/bloc/router_bloc` so that every route can be protected if needed.
You can [push][go_router_push], [pop][go_router_pop], [goToLocation][go_to_location] 
[push_replacement][go_router_push_replacement] or [go][go_router_go] as follows

```
context.read<RouterBlocType>().events.push(MyNewRoute())
```

```
context.read<RouterBlocType>().events.pop(Object())
```

```
context.read<RouterBlocType>().events.goToLocation('Location')
```

```
context.read<RouterBlocType>().events.pushReplacement(MyNewRoute())
```
or

```
context.read<RouterBlocType>().events.go(MyNewRoute())
```
### Deep linking

Your app is already configured to use deep links. Although you may still want to do some adjustments.

`iOS`
The configuration file can be found at `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
Under the `CFBundleURLTypes` key there are two things you may want to change:
1. `CFBundleURLName` unique URL used to distinguish your app from others that use the same scheme. The URL we build contains your `project name`, `organization name` and `domain name` you provided when setting up the project.
2. `CFBundleURLSchemes` the scheme name is your `organisation name` followed by `scheme`.

Example:

```
    <key>FlutterDeepLinkingEnabled</key>
    <true/>
    <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
    <array>
        <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>Editor</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>{{project_name}}.{{organization_name}}.{{domain_name}}</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
        <string>{{organization_name}}scheme</string>
        </array>
        </dict>
    </array>
```

You can test the deep-links on iOS simulator by executing the following command

Production
```
xcrun simctl openurl booted {{organization_name}}scheme://{{project_name}}.{{organization_name}}.{{domain_name}}/deepLinks/1
```

UAT
```
xcrun simctl openurl booted {{organization_name}}uatscheme://{{project_name}}uat.{{organization_name}}.{{domain_name}}/deepLinks/1
```

SIT
```
xcrun simctl openurl booted {{organization_name}}sitscheme://{{project_name}}sit.{{organization_name}}.{{domain_name}}/deepLinks/1
```

Development
```
xcrun simctl openurl booted {{organization_name}}devscheme://{{project_name}}development.{{organization_name}}.{{domain_name}}/deepLinks/1
```

`Android`
The configuration file can be found at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
There is a metadata tag `flutter_deeplinking_enabled` inside `<activity>` tag with the `.MainActivity` name. You may want to change the host name which again contains your `project name`, `organization name` and `domain name` you provided when the project was set up.

See [Deep linking][deep_linking_lnk] documentation at flutter.dev for more information.

### Access Control List

Your app supports ACL out of the box, which means that the access to every page can be controlled remotely by the corresponding API endpoint `/api/permissions`

Expected API Response structure/data for anonymous users.

**Note**: The anonymous users have access to the splash route, but not to the **profile** route.
```
{
    'SplashRoute': true,
    'ProfileRoute': false,
    ...
}
```

Expected structure/data for authenticated users.

**Note**: The authenticated users have access to the splash and profile route.
```
{
    'SplashRoute': true,
    'ProfileRoute': true,
    ...
}
```


You can use the [IntelliJ RxBloC Plugin][intellij_plugin], which automatically does all steps instead of you, or to manualy add the permission for your route to the `lib/lib_permissions/models/route_permissions.dart`.

## Adding a new feature

You can manually create new features as described above, but to speed up the product development you can use the [IntelliJ RxBloC Plugin][intellij_plugin], which not just creates the feature structure but also integrates it to the prefered routing solution (auto_route, [go_router][gorouter_lnk] or none)

If you decide to create your feature manually without using the plugin here is all necessary steps you should do to register this feature and to be able to use it in the application:
1. Add your feature path in the `RoutesPath` class which resides under  `lib/lib_router/models/routes_path.dart`:
```
   class RoutesPath {
      static const myNewFeature = ‘my-new-feature’;
      ...
   }
```

2. Add you feature permission name in the `RoutePermissions` class which resides under `lib/lib_permissions/models/route_permissions.dart`:
```
   class RoutePermissions {
       static const myNewFeature = MyNewFeatureRoute’;
       ...
   }
```

3. Next step is to declare the new features as part of the `RouteModel` enumeration which resides under `lib/lib_router/models/route_model.dart`:
```
   enum RouteModel {
       myNewFeature(
           pathName: RoutesPath.myNewFeature
           fullPath: '/my-new-feature',
           permissionName: RoutePermissions.myNewFeature,
       ),
       ...
   }
```

4. As a final step the route itself should be created. All routes are situated under `lib/lib_router/routes/` folder which contains different route files organised by the application flow. If the new route doesn’t fit the existing application flows it can be added to the `routes.dart` file which is the default file used by the IntelliJ plugin.
```
   @TypedGoRoute<MyFeatureRoute>(path: RoutesPath.myNewFeature)
   @immutable
   class MyFeatureRoute extends GoRouteData implements RouteDataModel {
       const MyFeatureRoute();
   
       @override
       Page<Function> buildPage(BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) =>
           MaterialPage(
             key: state.pageKey,
             child: const MyFeaturePage(),
           );
   
       @override
       String get permissionName => RouteModel.myNewFeature.permissionName;
   
       @override
       String get routeLocation => location;
   }
```

Now the new route can be navigated by calling one of the `RouterBloc` events (`go(...)`, `push(...)`).
Example:
```
context.read<RouterBlocType>().go(const MyFeatureRoute())
```

For more information you can refer to the official [GoRouter][gorouter_lnk] and [GoRouterBuilder][gorouter_builder_lnk] documentation.

## Localization

Your app supports [localization][localization_lnk] out of the box.

You define localizations by adding a translation file in the `lib/l10n/arb/[language_code].arb` directory. The `language_code` represents the code of the language you want to support (`en`, `zh`,`de`, ...). Inside that file, in JSON format, you define key-value pairs for your strings. **Make sure that all your translation files contain the same keys!**

If there are new keys added to the main translation file they can be propagated to the others by running the `bin/sync_translations.py` script. This script depends on the `pyyaml` library. If your python distribution does not include it you can install it by running `pip3 install pyyaml`.

Upon rebuild, your translations are auto-generated inside `lib/assets.dart`. In order to use them, you need to import the `l10n.dart` file from `lib/l10n/l10n.dart` and then access the translations from your BuildContext via `context.l10n.someTranslationKey` or `context.l10n.featureName.someTranslationKey`.

#### Remote localization lookup

Localization lookups are also supported. That means that you can request any remote localizations from a dedicated translations endpoint at app start (by default, all remote localizations are fetched during the splash screen). Grabbing any remote localization for existing features will replace the local translations with new ones.

The endpoint retrieving the updated translations should return an object containing key-value pairs (under the `translations` key) where the key is the language code, while the value is a translation file object containing values to be overwritten.

Example response:
```json
{
   "translations":{
      "en":{
         "_ok":"Okay",
         "login___logIn":"Login via email"
      },
      "bg":{
         "_ok":"ok",
         "login___logIn":"Вход с имейл"
      }
   }
}
```

One thing to note is that the keys in the translations follow a naming scheme which consists of three parts: the feature name, separator and the translation key. The feature name by default represents the feature under which the translations are categorized followed by two underscores. It is optional and if omitted, the key overrides are placed within the main translations. The separator is a character used to separate the feature name and the translation key. The translation key is the key within the specified feature used in the app.

Example:
```
Translations feature: feature_notifications
Feature name: notifications__
Separator: _
Translation key: ok
Full translation key (feature name+separator+translation key): notifications___ok
```

## Firebase Analytics

[Firebase analytics][firebase_analytics_lnk] track how your app is used. Analytics are available for iOS, Android and Web and support flavors.

Before you start using analytics, you need to add platform specific configurations:
1. The `iOS` configuration files can be found at `ios/environments/[flavor]]/firebase/GoogleService-Info.plist`
2. For `Android` the configuration files are located at `android/app/src/[flavor]/google-services.json`
3. All `Web` analytics configurations can be found inside `lib/base/app/config/firebase_web_config.js`

Every flavor represents a separate Firebase project that will be used for app tracking. For each flavor, based on the targeted platforms you'll have to download the [configuration files][firebase_configs_lnk] and place them in the appropriate location mentioned above.

After replacing the Firebase config files with your own, the next step is to configure your app to use the appropriate Firebase options. To do that, you need to provide the `Firebase.initializeApp` method (within the `configureApp` function located inside the `{project_root}/lib/base/app/initialization/app_setup.dart` file) with the desired configuration.

*Note*: When ran as `development` flavor, `.development` is appended to the package name. Likewise, `.sit` or `.uat` is appended to the package name when using `SIT` or `UAT` flavor. If using separate analytics for different flavors, make sure you specify the full package name with the correct extension (for instance: `com.companyname.projectname.development` for the `devevelopment` environment).

*Note 2*: The app comes with a pre-generated configuration allowing the project to be launched out-of-the-box and should be replaced with your own configuration (see [Firebase setup][firebase_setup_lnk] for more details).

## Http client

Your project has integrated HTTP-client, using [dio][dio_lnk] and [retrofit][retrofit_lnk]. That helps you to easily communicate with remote APIs and use interceptors, global configuration, form fata, request cancellation, file downloading, timeout etc.

To use its benefits you should define a data model in `lib/base/models/`, using [json_annotation][json_annotation_lnk] and [json_serializable][json_serializable_lnk]. Define your remote data source in folder `lib/base/data_sources/remote/` with methods and real Url, using [retrofit][retrofit_lnk]. In your dependencies class (for example: `lib/feature_counter/di/counter_dependencies.dart` ) specify which data source you are going to use in every repository.

JWT-based authentication and token management is supported out of the box.

## Design system

A [design system][design_system_lnk] is a centralized place where you can define your app`s design.  This includes typography, colors, icons, images and other assets. It also defines the light and dark themes of your app. By using a design system we ensure that a design change in one place is reflected across the whole app.

To access the design system from your app, you have to import it from the following location`lib/app/base/theme/design_system.dart'`. After that, you can access different parts of the design system by using the BuildContext (for example: `context.designSystem.typography.headline1` or `context.designSystem.icons.someIcon`).

<div id="goldenTests"/>

## Golden tests

A [golden test][golden_test_lnk] lets you generate golden master images of a widget or screen, and compare against them so you know your design is always pixel-perfect and there have been no subtle or breaking changes in UI between builds. To make this easier, we employ the use of the [golden_toolkit][golden_toolkit_lnk] package.

To get started, you just need to generate a list of `LabeledDeviceBuilder` and pass it to the `runGoldenTests` function. That's done by calling `generateDeviceBuilder` with a label, the widget/screen to be tested, as well as a `Scenario`. They provide an optional `onCreate` function which lets us execute arbitrary behavior upon testing. Each `DeviceBuilder` will have two generated golden master files, one for each theme.

Due to the way fonts are loaded in tests, any custom fonts you intend to golden test should be included in `pubspec.yaml`

In order for the goldens to be generated, we have provided VS Code and IDEA run configurations, as well as an executable `bin/generate_goldens.sh`. The golden masters will be located in `goldens/light_theme` and `goldens/dark_theme`. The `failures` folder is used in case of any mismatched tests.

<div id="server"/>

## Server

Your app comes with a small preconfigured local server (written in Dart) that you can use for testing purposes or even expand it. It is built using [shelf][shelf_lnk], [shelf_router][shelf_router_lnk] and [shelf_static][shelf_static_lnk]. The server comes with several out-of-the-box APIs that work with the generated app.

In order to run the server locally, make sure to run `bin/start_server.sh`. The server should be running on `http://0.0.0.0:8080`, if not configured otherwise.

Some of the important paths are:

| Path | Contains |
| :------------ | :------------ |
| `bin/server/` | The root directory of the server |
| `bin/server/start_server.dart` | The main entry point of the server app |
| `bin/server/config.dart` | All server-related configurations and secrets are located here |
| `bin/server/controllers/` | All controllers are located here |
| `bin/server/models/` | Data models are placed here |
| `bin/server/repositories/` | Repositories that are used by the controllers reside here |
| `bin/server/di/` | All server related dependencies are registered here |

*Note:* When creating a new controller, make sure you also register it inside the `ServerDependencies.registerControllers` method in `server_dependencies.dart`. Respectively, register any dependencies in the `ServerDependencies.registerDependencies` in the same file.

## Push notifications

[Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)][fcm_lnk] allows your integrating push notifications in your very own app. You can receive notifications while the app is in the foreground, background or even terminated. It even allows for event callbacks customizations, such when the app is opened via a notification from a specific state. All customizable callbacks can be found inside `lib/base/app/initialization/firebase_messaging_callbacks.dart`.

In order to make the notifications work on your target platform, make sure you first add the config file in the proper location (as described in the [**Analytic**](#analytics) section). For Web you also need to specify the `vapid` key inside `lib/base/app/config/app_constants.dart` and manually add the firebase web configuration to `web/firebase-messaging-sw.js`(for more info refer to [this link][fcm_web_config_ref]).

*Note:* On Android, FCM doesn't display heads-up notifications (notifications when the app is in foreground) by default. To display them while in app, we use a custom package called [flutter_local_notifications ][flutter_local_notifications_lnk]. This package also provides a way of customizing your notification icon which you can find at the `android/src/main/res/drawable` directory (supported types are `.png` and `.xml`).

*Note:* Since the app comes with a local server which can send notifications on demand, before using this feature, you need to create a server key for cloud messaging from the Firebase Console. Then you have to assign it to the `firebasePushServerKey` constant located inside the `bin/server/config.dart` file.

{{#enable_social_logins}}
## Social Logins Library

Allows you to authenticate users in your app with Apple, Google and Facebook.

#### Apple Authentication
It uses the [sign_in_with_apple](https://pub.dev/packages/sign_in_with_apple) package.  
In order to make it work, fulfill the requirements described in its [documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/latest/).

Supports iOS.
#### Google Authentication
Google authentication uses [google_sign_in](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in) package.
 
Follow the package documentation for registering your application and downloading Google Services file.(GoogleService-Info.plist/google-services.json)

`Android:`
For android integration you will need to copy ***google-services.json*** file to ***android/app/src/{name_of_the_environment}/*** 

`iOS:`
For iOS integration you will need to copy ***GoogleService-Info.plist*** file to ***ios/environments/{name_of_the_environment}/firebase/***  
and copy ***reversed_client_id*** from GoogleService-Info.plist to ***ios/Flutter/{name_of_the_environment}.xcconfig*** file

For any other configurations refer to the [google_sign_in](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in) package.  

#### Facebook Authentication
Facebook authentication uses [flutter_facebook_auth](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_facebook_auth) package.

`Step 1:`  
In order to make it work you must register your app in facebook developer console.

`Step 2:`  
There you will find your **app_id**, **client_token** and **app_name**.

`Step 3:`
- `3.1 Android:` Edit ***android/app/build.gradle***, paste parameters from step 2 in
 ```
productFlavors{
  name_of_the_enviroment{
  dimension "default"
            applicationIdSuffix ""
            versionNameSuffix ""
            resValue "string", "facebook_app_id", "insert_facebook_app_id_here"
            resValue "string", "facebook_client_token", "insert_client_token_here"
    }
  }
  ```

- `3.2 iOS:`
  Edit ***ios/Flutter/(flavor-name).xcconfig*** and paste parameters from step 2.


`Note:` Some requirements to be able to run application with this version of *facebook auth* is
- **flutter_secure_storage** package must be at least 8.0.0 version
- for iOS in ***Podfile*** platform must be at least 12
- for Android ***minSdkVersion*** must be at least 21.

All additional info about package and better explanation how to implement you can find in documentation [flutter_facebook_auth_documentation](https://facebook.meedu.app/docs/5.x.x/intro). {{/enable_social_logins}}
{{#enable_dev_menu}}
## Dev Menu

Dev menu brick is a useful feature when it comes to debugging your app and/or easily accessing some common development specific information and settings. You can define secret inputs which after being triggered a defined number of times will execute a callback. From that callback you can define any app-specific behaviors like navigating to a screen, displaying a dev modal sheet with additional data or your own behaviors.

### Widgets

Within the `dev_menu` brick you can find the `AppDevMenuGestureDetector` widget and the `showDevMenuBottomSheet` function.

#### AppDevMenuGestureDetector

The `AppDevMenuGestureDetector` widget is a widget that is listening for user interactions (quick taps or long taps) and as a result executes a callback (`onDevMenuPresented`) once a certain amount of interactions has been made.

As a good use case, you can wrap your page widget with this widget so you are able to access the functionality while on the same page.

```dart
  AppDevMenuGestureDetector.withDependencies(
    context,
    navKey!,
    child: materialApp,
      onDevMenuPresented: () {
        showAppDevMenuBottomSheet(
          context.read<AppRouter>().rootNavigatorKey.currentContext!,
        );
      },
  );

```
By default after you trigger  `AppDevMenuGestureDetector` you only need to add your proxy ip and restart app so you are all set to use Charles.
Alice is working right out of the box.

`Note:` To disable dev menu you only need to edit run configuration (Development or SIT) and remove `--dart-define="ENABLE_DEV_MENU=true"` from additional run arguments.{{/enable_dev_menu}}
{{#enable_patrol}}
## Patrol Integration Tests

Patrol allows developers to use native automation and custom finders to write integration tests faster.
The application comes with partial integration of the [patrol][patrol_pub_lnk] package Android and iOS. Before running the tests, make sure you've [integrated patrol with native side][patrol_native_integration_lnk] of your project.

To run patrol integration tests install [patrol_cli][patrol_cli_pub_lnk] package. 
This package enables applications to use native automation features

#### Running the Tests

To run a test type a command `patrol test --flavor flavor_name`, or use one of the preconfigured shell scripts provided within Android Studio{{/enable_patrol}}
{{#realtime_communication}}
## Realtime Communication

Provides base datasource, repository, service and utility classes for establishing a SSE connection.
Register the classes into the DI system and configure the SSE endpoint by passing it as a parameter to `SseRemoteDataSource`.
After this is done the event stream exposed by `SseService` can be used by any BLoC.{{/realtime_communication}}

## Feature OTP

The `feature_otp` brick contains a number of useful widgets that can help you with building sms/pin code screens or workflows for your app.  
The brick contains widgets for entering pin codes, pasting them, resend logic and more.
For more info please visit [widget_toolkit_otp](https://pub.dev/packages/widget_toolkit_otp)
{{#enable_auth_matrix}}
## Auth Matrix

The `lib_auth_matrix` brick contains classes, repositories, datasources and widgets that can help you with building a matrix authentication workflow for your app. It contains 4 new endpoints for initializing, verifying and canceling the matrix authentication process.{{/enable_auth_matrix}}
{{#cicd}}
## CI/CD

The project comes preconfigured with [Fastlane][fastlane_lnk] which allows building and deploying of android and iOS apps. All the necessary code can be found inside the `{app_directory}/fastlane/Fastfile` file. You may need to configure additional project related settings before it can run successfully (such as certificates, credentials, provisioning profiles, team id,...).

For more information on how to configure your Fastfile, please check out [this example][booking_app_lnk].{{/cicd}}
{{#cicd_github}}
#### Github

The generated project contains two reusable github workflows (one for building the iOS app and one for the Android one) and an example workflow which is run every time a tag with a specific name is pushed in your github repository. To trigger the pipeline, a tag with the following format has to be pushed:

```
{optional_prefix_text_ending_with_a_dash_sign-}{flavor}-v{build_name}+{build_number}
```

For example, the following tag name will trigger an Android and iOS build:
```
development-v1.2.3+45
```

After the apps are successfully built and signed, the artefacts can be downloaded from the completed github action from the Actions tab.{{/cicd_github}}
{{#enable_pin_code}}
## Feature Pin Code

The application provides a pin code functionality. Initially there is a create pin button, which
navigates you to the `CreatePinPage`. There you can enter and then confirm the pin that you chose.
Then a change pin button is displayed, from you are navigate to the `UpdatePinPage`, where you can
enter the current pin and then enter and confirm the new pin. After a pin is created and saved, on
the `UpdatePinPage` there is a biometrics button, from which you can enable usage of biometrics.
On app restart, you are navigated to the `VerifyPinPage` where you can either authenticate with a
pin or with biometrics. There is a session timeout listener, which navigates you to the `VerifyPinPage`
after a configurable amount of inactivity time and after a configurable amount of time, when the
app has been in background mode.
For more info please visit [widget_toolkit_pin](https://pub.dev/packages/widget_toolkit_pin)
{{/enable_pin_code}}

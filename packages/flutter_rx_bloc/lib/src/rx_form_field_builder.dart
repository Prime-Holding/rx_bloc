///   [RxFormFieldBuilder] is a convenience widget,
/// which makes it easier to build and update responsive form fields
/// with reactive [Stream]s.
///
///   It requires a [state] callback, which returns a [Stream] of values,
/// and can emmit errors which have to be of type [RxFieldException].
/// The values and errors are provided to the [builder] function
/// in order to be displayed.
///
///   If the [state] [Stream] emits an error that error is provided
/// to the [builder] function in order to be displayed.
///
///   Important! - any errors emitted by the [state] [Stream],
/// must be of type [RxFieldException]. The reason for this requirement
/// is that [RxFieldException] provides a value field as well as an error field,
/// and thus the value provided to the [builder]
/// is kept and not lost upon update.
///
///   It requires a [showErrorState] callback, which returns a [Stream] of
/// boolean values which determine when it is time to show any potential errors.
///   !The stream provided by [showErrorState] must never emmit an error.
///
///   A [builder] function is required, this is a function which gives you
/// access to the current field state, and must return a [Widget].
///
///   The field state provided to the builder function contains several useful
/// fields: bloc, value, error and showError; reference the documentation
/// of [RxFormFieldBuilderState] for more information on those fields.
///
///   You can optionally provide an [RxBloc] to the [bloc] field, if you do
/// the provided bloc would be used, otherwise [RxFormFieldBuilder]
/// automatically searches for and uses the closest instance up the widget tree
/// of [RxBloc] of type [B].
///
///  This is an example of how to make a radio button form field.
///
///  ```dart
///  Widget build(BuildContext context) =>

# RX Counter Example

The very known Flutter **'Counter'** example but this time using the power of reactive programming.

## Handled states

 * **Error state** 
    - As soon as users reach the min/max possible count they will be presented with an informative snack bar.
 * **Loading state**
    - While the API request is executing the action buttons will be disabled and a loading indicator will appear so that the user will know that something is happening
 * **Success state**
    - The count will be updated only if the API returns a success response as the widget responsible for showing the counter will not be rebuilt in case of loading or error, but just the success state.

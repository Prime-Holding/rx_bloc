/// Interceptors are a simple way to intercept and modify http requests globally

/// authentication tokens, add logs of the requests,
/// add custom headers and much more.
/// Interceptors can perform a variety of implicit tasks, from authentication
/// to logging, for every HTTP request/response. Without interception, we will
/// have to implement these tasks explicitly for each HttpClient method call.
/// We use analytics interceptor to push notifications, present adds
/// and collect data for users behaviour.
/// You should implement one or more methods from the contract.

# How  to contribute

We are happy to accept contributions from the community. Please follow the guidelines below to contribute to the project.

## General

Open a pull request with a detailed description of the changes you are making. 

When adding a new feature, please include a brief description of the feature and the motivation behind it.

If you are fixing a bug, please include a description of the bug and how it was fixed. 
Make sure to reference a previously created issue if one exists, or [create a new one][rx_bloc_issues_new] with reproducible steps if it doesn't exist.

## rx_bloc_cli

Before contributing to the `rx_bloc_cli` package, make sure you're familiar with the [Mason CLI][mason_cli_pub] package.
We use Mason CLI to conditionally generate the boilerplate code for the `rx_bloc_cli` generated projects using file template collections (aka. bricks).

Before opening a pull request, make sure to go through the [`rx_bloc_cli` bricks documentation][rx_bloc_cli_brick_docs].
